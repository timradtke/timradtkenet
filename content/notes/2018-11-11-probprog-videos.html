<p>Videos of the talks given at the <a href="https://probprog.cc">International Conference on Probabilistic Programming</a> (PROBPROG 2018) back in October were published a few days ago and are now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_PW0E_Tf2qvXBEpl10Y39RULTN-ExzZQ">available on Youtube</a>. I have not watched all presentations yet, but a lot of big names attended the conference so there should be something for everyone. In particular the talks by Brooks Paige (<a href="https://youtu.be/X7ED8Fi1948">“Semi-Interpretable Probabilistic Models”</a>) and Michael Tingley (<a href="https://youtu.be/gn6M8MX8jpI">“Probabilistic Programming at Facebook”</a>) made me curious to explore their topics more.</p>
