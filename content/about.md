title: About Minimize Regret
---

**Minimize Regret** is a blog written by me, Tim Radtke. I live in Berlin, where I work as data scientist at the lovetoy online shop [Amorelie](https://amorelie.de) (NSFW, I suppose); contact me for a coupon code :heart_eyes:. To answer your question: No, not everyone at Amorelie is a product tester. Instead, I'm tasked with things like forecasting the demand for lube during Christmas and New Year's Eve.

I recently finished my master's in statistics and graduated with honors. My master's thesis on multi-armed bandits was supervised by Alexandra Carpentier and Marius Kloft. 

Speaking of multi-armed bandits, the name of this site comes from a conversation with my colleague Carlo: One can test different variations of a website using bandit algorithms to find the best performing one. When serving variations to users of the website, the algorithm tries to minimize its cumulative regret from not displaying the website with the best conversion rate, for example. Thus, the winning website variation minimizes the regret. Carlo concluded: **Winners minimize regret**.
