Videos of the talks given at the [International Conference on Probabilistic Programming](https://probprog.cc) (PROBPROG 2018) back in October were published a few days ago and are now [available on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_PW0E_Tf2qvXBEpl10Y39RULTN-ExzZQ). I have not watched all presentations yet, but a lot of big names attended the conference so there should be something for everyone. In particular the talks by Brooks Paige (["Semi-Interpretable Probabilistic Models"](https://youtu.be/X7ED8Fi1948)) and Michael Tingley (["Probabilistic Programming at Facebook"](https://youtu.be/gn6M8MX8jpI)) made me curious to explore their topics more.
