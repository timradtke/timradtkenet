<p>I just published a longer case study, <a href="https://minimizeregret.com/short-time-series-prior-knowledge/">Modeling Short Time Series with Prior Knowledge: What ‘Including Prior Information’ really looks like</a>.</p>
<p>It is generally difficult to model time series when there is insuffient data to model a (suspected) long seasonality. We show how this difficulty can be overcome by learning a seasonality on a different, long related time series and transferring the posterior as a prior distribution to the model of the short time series. The result is a forecast that is believable and can be used for decisions in a business context. In contrast to traditional methods that are not able to incorporate the long seasonality, we observe a drastic increase in common evaluation metrics. Default models in the <code>forecast</code> and <code>prophet</code> R packages fail to produce good forecasts on this example.</p>
