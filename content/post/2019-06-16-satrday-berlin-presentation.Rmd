*My satRday Berlin slides on "Modeling Short Time Series" [are available here](https://minimizeregret.com/presentations/satrday_berlin_modeling_short_time_series.pdf).*

This saturday, June 15, Berlin had its first [satRday conference](https://satrdays.org). I eagerly followed the hashtags of satRday Amsterdam last year and satRday Capetown the year before that on Twitter. Thanks to Noa Tamir, Jakob Graff, Steve Cunningham, [and many others](https://berlin2019.satrdays.org/#team), we got a [conference in Berlin](https://berlin2019.satrdays.org) as well.

When I saw the call for papers, I jumped at the opportunity to present, trying what it feels like to be on the other side of the microphone; being in the hashtag instead of following it. Thanks again to the organizers for having me, it has been a fantastic experience. The conference format is accessible and a lot of fun.

You can find my slides from yesterday on ["Modeling Short Time Series" as PDF here](https://minimizeregret.com/presentations/satrday_berlin_modeling_short_time_series.pdf). The slides are based [on this blog post](https://minimizeregret.com/short-time-series-prior-knowledge/) which provides more context.
