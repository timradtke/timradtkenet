<p>Last week, I gave a presentation about the concept of and intuition behind probabilistic programming and model-based machine learning in front of a general audience. You can read my <a href="https://minimizeregret.com/probprog/">extended notes here</a>.</p>
<p>Drawing on ideas from Winn and Bishop’s <a href="http://mbmlbook.com/Introduction.html">“Model-Based Machine Learning”</a> and van de Meent et al.’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10756">“An Introduction to Probabilistic Programming”</a>, I try to show why the combination of a data-generating process with an abstracted inference is a powerful concept by walking through the example of a simple survival model.</p>

<p>Preparing this document gave me an excuse to try the wonderful <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/tufte/">Tufte handout style for R Markdown documents</a> by JJ Allaire and Yihui Xie. Furthermore, inspired by the work of Jessica Hullman, Matthew Kay, and Claus Wilke, I gave my best shot at creating <a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/visualizing-uncertainty-with-hypothetical-outcomes-plots">hypothetical outcome plots</a> to visualize the uncertainty induced by the prior distribution. I couldn’t have done it without David Robinson’s and Thomas Lin Pedersen’s <a href="https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate">gganimate</a> package.</p>
