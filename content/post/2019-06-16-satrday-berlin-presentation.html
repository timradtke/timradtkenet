<p><em>My satRday Berlin slides on “Modeling Short Time Series” <a href="https://minimizeregret.com/presentations/satrday_berlin_modeling_short_time_series.pdf">are available here</a>.</em></p>
<p>This saturday, June 15, Berlin had its first <a href="https://satrdays.org">satRday conference</a>. I eagerly followed the hashtags of satRday Amsterdam last year and satRday Capetown the year before that on Twitter. Thanks to Noa Tamir, Jakob Graff, Steve Cunningham, <a href="https://berlin2019.satrdays.org/#team">and many others</a>, we got a <a href="https://berlin2019.satrdays.org">conference in Berlin</a> as well.</p>
<p>When I saw the call for papers, I jumped at the opportunity to present, trying what it feels like to be on the other side of the microphone; being in the hashtag instead of following it. Thanks again to the organizers for having me, it has been a fantastic experience. The conference format is accessible and a lot of fun.</p>
<p>You can find my slides from yesterday on <a href="https://minimizeregret.com/presentations/satrday_berlin_modeling_short_time_series.pdf">“Modeling Short Time Series” as PDF here</a>. The slides are based <a href="https://minimizeregret.com/short-time-series-prior-knowledge/">on this blog post</a> which provides more context.</p>
